Mathematical Analysis
Outer Loop: Runs n times 
Inner Loop: Runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop.

Total Comparisons:
         Total comparisons=n+n+n+…+n (n times)=n×n=n^2
 
Time Complexity:
         Since the total number of operations is proportional to n^2 , the worst-case time complexity is 𝑂(𝑛^2)
